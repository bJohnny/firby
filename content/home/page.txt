Text:   ##Congratulations!

You have successfully installed Kirby CMS with Foundation 6, Sass and Gulp.

Kirby is a great CMS with no database. It's a piece of cake, so check out the (link: https://getkirby.com/docs text:
Kirby documentation popup: yes).

## Go nuts!

You are ready to go. There is a basic HTML Template for you. There is no need to be a super-skilled front-end developer to add templates and styles. (link: http://foundation.zurb.com text: Foundation 6 popup: yes) is already included.

If you are a front-end developer and you prefer to have a customized Foundation, go ahead and use Sass to overwrite the settings and add your own styles. There is a Gulpfile included to take care of that, too.

**Happy Coding :-)**
